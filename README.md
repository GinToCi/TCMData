# TCM_Data
The data needed for the experiment is from the website of traditional Chinese medicine data (https://db.yaozh.com/). This website provides a large number of medical literature resources and records of prescriptions handed down by predecessors, constituting a valuable big data of traditional Chinese medicine. First, the study collected all the prescription data on the website, extracted traditional Chinese medicine keywords from the original text, and constructed a complex network data set. The traditional Chinese medicine is defined as a node in the network. There is an edge between two traditional Chinese medicine nodes in the same prescription, and the weight of the edge is the frequency of the occurrence of the two herbs in different prescriptions.
